# Tree_Graph
Eigen-analysis of the tree graph of a directed graph, particularly the directed complete graph $K_n$.

The pdf is a complete version for the course project compared to the blog version ().

Spanning_trees.ipynb provides all code for this project. However, I'm too lazy to clean up the code so it's a mess.

tree_adj_and_tree_graph_3/4/5.npz records adjacency matrices of all spanning trees and the tree graph of the directed complete graph $K_3, K_4, K_5$. 
There should be a tree_adj_and_tree_graph_6.npz, but it's too big (463MB) to upload.

Hope you to prove or falsify the three conjectures in the paper ðŸ˜Š
